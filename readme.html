      You need 1 people to maintain 2 castle. If you want a bigger castle, you need to convert more people.<br><br>
      If you find yourself fighting some tough enemies, give yourself more solider and boost your attack and defense!<br><br>
      Making your castle bigger will increase your battle defense.<br><br>
